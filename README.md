## Welcome to my profile!

I'm a professional C++ developer, learning Rust in my free time.

## My projects
I prefer to keep a secret on the most recent projects, but here you can find a bunch of older games.

### Rusty Minesweeper
It is a minimalistic minesweeper written in Rust and played totally in the command line. My goal was to learn the Rust language by using it.
Check out [the repository](https://github.com/zerocukor287/rust_minesweeper)!

### Bowling - Unreal Engine
This is a small bowling game using Unreal Engine. I started it in UE4, then migrated to UE5. I learned how to combine C++ with Blueprints.

### Physical Based Rendering
This is the 'hello-world' application of PBR redering - using DirectX12 with C++.
